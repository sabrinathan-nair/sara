# Sara's Big Adventure Plan!

This is Sara's special plan for growing up and becoming an even better helper for your data (your toys!). We want to make sure Sara is super smart, super fast, and super easy to play with!

## Phase 1: Make Sara Super Careful! (Completed!)

**Goal:** We taught Sara to be super careful and check all the rules *before* you even start playing. No more surprises or broken toys!

**What We Did:** We made sure Sara checks everything about your toys (your data) very, very carefully. If you try to do something wrong, Sara tells you right away, like a friendly grown-up saying, "Oops, that's not how we play!" This means fewer "oopsies" when you're playing with your data.

## Phase 2: Make Sara Super Fast! (In Progress)

**Goal:** We want Sara to play with your toys even faster! Sometimes, Sara has to think a lot about each toy, and we want to make that thinking quicker.

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **See How Fast Sara Is Now:** We've timed Sara to see how fast it plays with toys right now. (Completed!)
2.  **Find Better Ways to Store Toys:** We'll look for smarter ways for Sara to keep your toys inside its brain, so it doesn't have to think so hard.
3.  **Teach Sara New Tricks:** We'll teach Sara new ways to play with toys that are faster.
4.  **Check if Sara is Faster:** We'll time Sara again to see if it learned to play faster!

## Phase 3: Make Sara Super Easy to Talk To!

**Goal:** We want it to be super easy for you to tell Sara what to do. No more long, confusing words!

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **Use Simple Words:** We'll teach Sara to understand simple words, so you don't have to say "Proxy" all the time.
2.  **Make Shortcuts:** We'll make special shortcuts for common games, so you can tell Sara to do many things with just a few words.
3.  **Clear Instructions:** We'll make sure Sara's instructions are super clear, like a picture book.
4.  **Better Help:** We'll write better help guides, so you can easily find out how to play with Sara.

## Phase 4: Make Sara Play with Other Friends!

**Goal:** We want Sara to be able to play nicely with other smart computer friends who also like data.

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **Find New Friends:** We'll find other computer friends that Sara can play with.
2.  **Teach Sara to Share:** We'll teach Sara how to share its toys (data) with these new friends.
3.  **Super Fast Sharing:** For very big games, we'll teach Sara super fast ways to share with its friends.

## Phase 5: Make Sara Super Helpful When Things Go Wrong!

**Goal:** If Sara ever gets confused, we want it to tell you exactly what happened and how to fix it, like a helpful teacher.

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **Clear Messages:** We'll make Sara's messages super clear, so you know exactly what went wrong.
2.  **Helpful Hints:** If you make a common mistake, Sara will give you helpful hints on how to fix it.
3.  **Easy-to-Understand Guide:** We'll make a special guide that explains all the common problems and how to solve them.

This plan might change a little bit, just like when you're playing and decide to try a new game!
