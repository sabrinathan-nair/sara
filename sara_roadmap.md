# Sara's Big Adventure Plan!

This is Sara's special plan for growing up and becoming an even better helper for your data (your toys!). We want to make sure Sara is super smart, super fast, and super easy to play with!

## Phase 1: Make Sara Super Careful! (Completed!)

**Goal:** We taught Sara to be super careful and check all the rules *before* you even start playing. No more surprises or broken toys!

**What We Did:** We made sure Sara checks everything about your toys (your data) very, very carefully. If you try to do something wrong, Sara tells you right away, like a friendly grown-up saying, "Oops, that's not how we play!" This means fewer "oopsies" when you're playing with your data.

## Phase 2: Make Sara Super Fast! (In Progress)

**Goal:** We want Sara to play with your toys even faster! Sometimes, Sara has to think a lot about each toy, and we want to make that thinking quicker.

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **Benchmark Current Performance:**
    *   **1.1. Set up Benchmarking Infrastructure:** Established a robust benchmarking environment using `criterion`. (Completed!)
    *   **1.2. Initial Performance Measurement:** Obtained baseline performance metrics for core DataFrame operations, starting with `filterRows`. (Completed!)

2.  **Implement Streaming for Large Datasets:**
    *   **2.1. Research Streaming Libraries:** Researched `pipes`, `conduit`, `streaming`, and `streamly`. Decided to proceed with the `streaming` library due to its simplicity, flexibility, and good fit for the project's type-safety goals. `streamly` will be considered if higher performance is required. (Completed!)
    *   **2.2. Identify Streaming Candidates:** Pinpointed `readCSV`, `readJSON`, `filterRows`, `applyColumn`, `joinDF`, and aggregation functions as primary candidates for streaming. (Completed!)
    *   **2.3. Design Streaming Data Flow:** Architected a streaming data flow using the `streaming` library, where each row is processed as a single-row `DataFrame`. (Completed!)
    *   **2.4. Develop Core Streaming Functionalities:** Implemented `readCsvStreaming` and `readJSONStreaming` to handle large datasets efficiently. Implemented streaming for `filterRows` and `applyColumn`. (Partially Completed!)
    *   **2.5. Benchmark Streaming Performance:** Benchmarked `filterRows` with streaming. (Partially Completed!)

3.  **Optimize Data Structures:**
    *   **3.1. Analyze Current Data Structure Usage:** Profile memory consumption and access patterns of existing `Map Text Column` and `Vector DFValue` structures.
    *   **3.2. Identify Data Structure Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint areas where current data structures lead to inefficient memory usage or slow access times.
    *   **3.3. Explore Alternative Data Structures:** Investigate more performant alternatives, such as unboxed vectors, specialized hash maps, or column-oriented storage techniques.
    *   **3.4. Implement and Benchmark Data Structure Changes:** Refactor DataFrame internals to incorporate optimized data structures and measure their impact on overall performance.

4.  **Improve Algorithms:**
    *   **4.1. Profile Existing Algorithms:** Use profiling tools to identify performance hotspots within current DataFrame algorithms (e.g., sorting, joining, aggregation).
    *   **4.2. Research Optimized Algorithms:** Explore and select more efficient algorithms for identified bottlenecks, considering their computational complexity and suitability for functional programming.
    *   **4.3. Implement Optimized Algorithms:** Replace existing algorithms with their optimized versions, ensuring correctness and type safety.
    *   **4.4. Consider Parallelization:** Investigate opportunities for parallelizing computationally intensive DataFrame operations to leverage multi-core processors.

5.  **Verify Performance Gains:**
    *   **5.1. Establish Comprehensive Performance Test Suite:** Expand the benchmark suite to cover a wider range of DataFrame operations and dataset sizes.
    *   **5.2. Automate Benchmark Execution and Reporting:** Set up continuous integration (CI) to automatically run benchmarks and generate reports, tracking performance trends over time.
    *   **5.3. Analyze and Interpret Results:** Regularly review benchmark results, identify regressions or significant improvements, and use insights to guide further optimization efforts.

## Phase 3: Make Sara Super Easy to Talk To!

**Goal:** We want it to be super easy for you to tell Sara what to do. No more long, confusing words!

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **Use Simple Words:** We'll teach Sara to understand simple words, so you don't have to say "Proxy" all the time.
2.  **Make Shortcuts:** We'll make special shortcuts for common games, so you can tell Sara to do many things with just a few words.
3.  **Clear Instructions:** We'll make sure Sara's instructions are super clear, like a picture book.
4.  **Better Help:** We'll write better help guides, so you can easily find out how to play with Sara.

## Phase 4: Make Sara Play with Other Friends!

**Goal:** We want Sara to be able to play nicely with other smart computer friends who also like data.

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **Find New Friends:** We'll find other computer friends that Sara can play with.
2.  **Teach Sara to Share:** We'll teach Sara how to share its toys (data) with these new friends.
3.  **Super Fast Sharing:** For very big games, we'll teach Sara super fast ways to share with its friends.

## Phase 5: Make Sara Super Helpful When Things Go Wrong!

**Goal:** If Sara ever gets confused, we want it to tell you exactly what happened and how to fix it, like a helpful teacher.

**How We'll Do It:**

1.  **Clear Messages:** We'll make Sara's messages super clear, so you know exactly what went wrong.
2.  **Helpful Hints:** If you make a common mistake, Sara will give you helpful hints on how to fix it.
3.  **Easy-to-Understand Guide:** We'll make a special guide that explains all the common problems and how to solve them.

This plan might change a little bit, just like when you're playing and decide to try a new game!
