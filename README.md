# Sara: Your Super Smart Data Helper!

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and each toy has a special label telling you what it is (like 'red car' or 'blue block'). Sara is like a super smart helper that makes sure you always play with your toys the right way!

## What Sara Does (The Magic!)

Sara helps you play with your data (which are like your toys) without making silly mistakes. It has special magic rules that check everything *before* you even start playing. So, no broken toys or mixed-up parts!

### Sara's Super Powers:

-   **No Oopsies!** Sara checks your data rules very carefully. If you try to do something wrong (like adding a car to a pile of blocks), Sara says, "Whoa! That's not right!" *before* you even try it. It's like having a grown-up tell you the rules of the game before you play.

-   **Smart Rules:** Sara uses very clever rules to understand your data. It knows what kind of toy each piece of data is, so it can help you sort them, count them, and put them together perfectly.

-   **Playing with Your Data:** Sara can do lots of cool things with your data, like:
    -   **Finding Special Toys:** "Show me all the red cars!" (Filtering)
    -   **Changing Toys:** "Make all the small blocks big!" (Transforming)
    -   **Sorting Toys:** "Put all the toys from smallest to biggest!" (Sorting)
    -   **Adding New Toys:** "Let's add a new shiny toy to the box!" (Mutating)
    -   **Counting and Grouping Toys:** "How many red cars do I have? And how many blue blocks?" (Aggregating)
    -   **Putting Toy Boxes Together:** "Let's combine these two toy boxes into one big one!" (Joining)

-   **Reading Your Toy Lists:** Sara can read your toy lists from special papers (like CSV and JSON files) and even guess what kind of toys are on the list!

## How Sara is Doing Now

Sara is super good now! It has learned all its magic rules perfectly, so it almost never makes mistakes when playing with your data. It's like a super careful friend who helps you keep your toys in perfect order.

We've also started making Sara even faster by adding special tools to measure how quickly it plays with your data. This helps us find ways to make it even quicker!

Sometimes, if your toy list is ripped or missing, Sara might get a little confused. But for all the playing and sorting inside, Sara is super reliable!

## How to Get Sara (and Play!)

To get Sara and start playing, you need a special helper called **Haskell**.
