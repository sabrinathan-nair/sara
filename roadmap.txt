Roadmap: Elevating `sara` Beyond `Frames`

1.  **Deepened Type-Level Guarantees & Ergonomics:**
    *   **Type-Safe Column Access & Manipulation:** Extend the current static typing to ensure all column operations (selection, addition, mutation, filtering) are fully type-checked at compile-time, preventing runtime errors from misspelled column names or type mismatches. This would involve more advanced Template Haskell or GHC extensions.
    *   **Schema Evolution & Versioning:** Implement mechanisms to handle changes in CSV or database schemas gracefully. This could involve type-level migrations or tools to automatically update `sara` code when external data sources change, reducing maintenance overhead.
    *   **Type-Safe Joins & Merges:** Ensure that join keys are type-checked across DataFrames, guaranteeing compatibility and preventing common join errors at compile time.

2.  **Performance & Scalability for Large Datasets:**
    *   **Streaming DataFrames:** Introduce a robust streaming API (e.g., using `conduit` or `pipes`) to enable processing of datasets larger than available memory, allowing `sara` to handle "big data" scenarios efficiently.
    *   **Optimized Internal Representation:** Explore and implement more memory-efficient and performant internal data structures (e.g., unboxed vectors for homogeneous columns, specialized representations for categorical data) to reduce memory footprint and improve computation speed.
    *   **Parallel Processing Integration:** Leverage Haskell's concurrency features to parallelize computationally intensive DataFrame operations (e.g., large aggregations, complex transformations) across multiple CPU cores.

3.  **Expanded Data Source Connectivity:**
    *   **Comprehensive Database Integration:** Develop first-class support for popular relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL) and potentially NoSQL databases. This would involve:
        *   Direct reading/writing of DataFrames to/from database tables.
        *   Translating `sara` DataFrame operations into optimized SQL queries.
        *   Type-safe schema reflection from databases.
    *   **Diverse File Format Support:** Add native support for other common data formats beyond CSV, such as Parquet, ORC, JSON, Avro, and Excel, to broaden `sara`'s applicability.

4.  **Advanced Data Manipulation & Analysis Features:**
    *   **Window Functions:** Implement powerful windowing capabilities for time-series and grouped data, allowing for calculations over defined sliding or expanding windows (e.g., moving averages, cumulative sums, rank).
    *   **Categorical Data Type:** Introduce a dedicated, optimized data type for categorical variables, enabling more efficient storage, specialized operations, and better integration with statistical models.
    *   **Advanced Reshaping Operations:** Provide more sophisticated data reshaping functionalities (e.g., `pivot`, `melt`, `stack`, `unstack`) for flexible data transformation, crucial for preparing data for analysis.
    *   **Sparse Data Structures:** For datasets with many missing values, implement sparse data structures to optimize storage and computation.

5.  **Enhanced Developer Experience & Ecosystem:**
    *   **Improved Error Messages:** Continue refining error messages to be even more user-friendly, providing clear guidance and suggestions for resolution, especially for complex type errors.
    *   **Interactive REPL Experience:** Enhance the `sara` REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for a more interactive and exploratory data analysis experience, possibly with auto-completion and richer output.
    *   **Integration with Visualization Libraries:** Provide helper functions or direct integration with Haskell visualization libraries (e.g., `Chart`, `gloss`) to easily plot `sara` DataFrames.
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation & Tutorials:** Develop extensive, high-quality documentation with numerous real-world examples and tutorials to lower the barrier to entry for new users.
