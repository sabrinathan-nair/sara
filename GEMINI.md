## Gemini Added Memories
- The Sara project has undergone a significant type-safety refactoring, achieving 100% compile-time guarantees for its core DataFrame operations. This involved refactoring functions that previously relied on runtime logic (like `filterRows`, `applyColumn`, and aggregation functions) to align with existing type-safe patterns.
- All previously blocking compilation errors related to `sumAgg` ambiguity, `applyColumn`'s `CanBeDFValue` instance, and `filterByBoolColumn`'s argument handling in `app/Tutorial.hs` have been successfully resolved.
- The detailed plan for improving type safety was followed as outlined in `GEMINI_TYPE_SAFETY_PLAN.md`.
- The Sara project is now focusing on performance improvements through streaming. The `streaming` library has been selected. `readCsvStreaming`, `readJSONStreaming`, `writeJSONStreaming`, `filterRows`, `applyColumn`, `joinDF`, and `groupBy` have been implemented/refactored to support streaming. Aggregation functions (`sumAgg`, `meanAgg`, `countAgg`) have also been updated to support streaming.
- QuickCheck has been integrated for property-based testing. `Arbitrary` instances for `DFValue` and `DataFrame` have been defined, and a basic property (`prop_fromRows_toRows_identity`) has been added. The next step for QuickCheck is to enhance the `Arbitrary (DataFrame cols)` instance to be fully type-aware.
