# Improving Testing in the Sara Project

This document outlines a series of steps to enhance the testing strategy for the Sara project, ordered from least to most difficult to implement.

## 1. Expand Unit Test Coverage (Least Difficult)
*   **Action:** Write more focused unit tests for individual functions and modules, especially for edge cases, error conditions, and newly added features.
*   **Details:** Identify functions with low test coverage or complex logic. Ensure that all branches of conditional statements are tested.
*   **Tools:** Existing Hspec framework.

## 2. Enhance QuickCheck Properties
*   **Action:** Develop more sophisticated and comprehensive QuickCheck properties to cover a wider range of data transformations and invariants.
*   **Details:** Focus on properties that should hold true regardless of input data (e.g., `sort . sort = sort`, `filter . filter = filter`). Consider using custom `Arbitrary` instances for complex data types.
*   **Tools:** Existing QuickCheck library.

## 3. Implement Integration Tests
*   **Action:** Create tests that verify the correct interaction between multiple modules or components.
*   **Details:** Simulate end-to-end workflows, such as reading data from a file, performing several DataFrame operations, and then writing to another file. This helps catch bugs that arise from component interactions.
*   **Tools:** Hspec, potentially with temporary file creation utilities.

## 4. Set Up Code Coverage Analysis
*   **Action:** Integrate a code coverage tool to identify untested parts of the codebase.
*   **Details:** Use a Haskell code coverage tool (e.g., `hpc`) to generate reports that highlight lines, branches, or functions not exercised by the test suite. This provides a clear roadmap for where to add more tests.
*   **Tools:** `hpc` (Haskell Program Coverage).

## 5. Develop Performance Benchmarks
*   **Action:** Expand the existing benchmarking suite to cover critical DataFrame operations and streaming pipelines.
*   **Details:** Use the `criterion` library to measure the execution time and memory usage of key functions with realistic data sizes. This helps identify performance regressions and bottlenecks.
*   **Tools:** Existing `criterion` library.

## 6. Introduce Fuzz Testing (More Difficult)
*   **Action:** Generate large volumes of semi-random, malformed, or unexpected inputs to stress-test parsing, data handling, and transformation functions.
*   **Details:** This can uncover crashes or unexpected behavior that traditional unit tests might miss. It's particularly useful for input/output functions and complex data processing.
*   **Tools:** May require custom generators or specialized fuzzing libraries.

## 7. Implement Mutation Testing (More Difficult)
*   **Action:** Automatically introduce small, deliberate faults (mutations) into the code and run the test suite to ensure these faults are detected.
*   **Details:** If a test suite fails when a mutation is introduced, it means the test is effective. If it passes, the test might be insufficient. This helps assess the quality of the test suite itself.
*   **Tools:** Specialized mutation testing frameworks for Haskell (may require research or custom development).

## 8. Explore Formal Verification / Refinement Types (Most Difficult)
*   **Action:** Investigate and potentially integrate advanced techniques like Liquid Haskell for formal verification or refinement types.
*   **Details:** This involves adding annotations to the code that allow a theorem prover to verify properties beyond what the type system can guarantee (e.g., array bounds, non-null pointers, specific value ranges). This provides the strongest guarantees but has a steep learning curve.
*   **Tools:** Liquid Haskell.

## 9. Implement Continuous Integration (CI)
*   **Action:** Set up an automated CI pipeline to run all tests (unit, integration, QuickCheck, benchmarks, coverage) on every code push.
*   **Details:** This ensures that new changes don't introduce regressions and that the codebase remains stable. It provides immediate feedback on the health of the project.
*   **Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc. (requires external setup).
